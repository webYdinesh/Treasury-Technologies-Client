As a leader your main focus was to enable your followers lead themselves. As i think deeper i realise a person cannot choose to be a leader. I think a lot of the time people take on leadership positions without knowing. For example The role of leading your siblings because you are the first child is not by choice you just become a leader in that situation by birth. Although someone might argue that for some leadership positions a person has to choose to run for that position. I think this perception only applies to big leadership positions which constitute a minimal number of leadership positions.",
